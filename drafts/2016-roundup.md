Thanks to all of you who have followed my blog this year! It was a busy year and I didn't get as many posts out as years past, but you all have been as supportive as ever.  I'm excited about the things I've been able to do with the new site this month, and am looking forward to a great 2017.  But first, a look back.

### Most Read Posts of 2016

<!-- TODO: Add posts here -->

### Code I wrote in 2016

Most of the code I wrote this year was for my work at Windsor Circle.  But I have spent some time getting this blog up and running, and anyone interested in what it takes to get a fully functioning blog running on [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) is welcome to take a look at the [github repo](https://github.com/benmccormick/benmccormickorg).  


### Languages, Libraries, and Technologies I started using in 2016

- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) is a JavaScript testing library that I started using this year. It's fantastic, and I've had the opportunity to [write](http://benmccormick.org/2016/09/19/testing-with-jest-snapshots-first-impressions/) and [speak](http://benmccormick.org/2016/12/10/saving-time-with-jest/) about it a few times already.

- [Gatsbyjs](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) now powers this blog. Gatsby is a ReactJS based static site generator, and it has been a pleasure to work with.

- My team started using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) this year.  It's been a mixed bag for me personally, but I love the idea of what it provides

### Languages, Libraries, and Technologies I stopped using in 2016

- Despite my affection for [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/), I'm no longer actively using it other than in some legacy code in my work application

### Languages and Libraries I used (more or less) every day in 2016

JavaScript (ES6), Python, React, PostgreSQL, Backbone, lodash

### Languages and Libraries I want to try in 2017

RxJS, Flow, VueJS, [Victory](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory), Pandas and other python data analysis libraries

### Software I started using in 2016

- Google Inbox + Airmail for email: I'm not sure I'm ever going to be happy with an email client, but I'm currently using the combo of Google Inbox on iOS and Airmail on MacOS.  Post [Mailbox](https://www.mailboxapp.com/), Inbox is my favorite iOS mail app.  On desktop though I like to have universal inbox and tight integration with the rest of the operating system, so I use Airmail, which is less bad than the rest of the MacOS mail clients I've tried

- [Copied](http://copiedapp.com/): Copied is a clipboard manager for MacOS (and sort of iOS).  It's been great to be able to keep multiple things in the clipboard at once, and be able to go back and get something if I blow it away.  I'm not a power user.  I haven't really figured out a reason to use their lists features, or their iOS client, but it has been great for the limited things I use it for.


- Homebrew Cask: I've used homebrew for a while.  But being able to install GUI apps as easily as command line apps has been pretty amazing.  If you are on OSX and don't use homebrew to install pretty much everything, you're missing out.  Of course the real effect is that it makes me dread and hate the Mac App Store even more.


- The New York Times App: Ok this is a bit of a cheat since this is more about content than software, but if you're out of touch on what is going on in the world, there's never been a better time to support a good source of news and reporting, whichever outlet is your preference.

### Software I stopped using in 2016

Nothing that I'm aware of?


### Software I used (nearly) every day in 2016

MacOS/iOS, Google Search, Chrome/Safari, Google Inbox/Airmail, Twitter/Tweetbot, Feedbin/Reeder, Instapaper, iMessage, Slack, Trello, 1Password, Atom/Vim, iTerm, Fish Shell, tmux, Bitbucket, Fantastical, Spotify, Evernote, Skitch, Dash
