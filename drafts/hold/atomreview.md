# The Hackable Editor: A text editor geek's review of Atom

Programmers are passionate about their tools.  And there is no tool that programmers use more than their text editor or IDE.  So its no surprise that text editors both new and old get a lot of attention.  My [series on Vim][learnvim] that I wrote last summer remains the most popular set of posts that I've written on this site, and it's hard to go a week without a story involving a text editor or IDE making it to a top 10 spot on [Hacker News][hn].  Programmers also love [Github][gh], the home of 90% of the open source software available on the internet today.  Finally, people love to hate JavaScript, and love to hate [coffeescript][coffee] even more.  So when Github announced last year that they were releasing a new text editor written using web technologies that would be extensible primarily through CoffeeScript, it was more or less a perfect storm of programmer emotion.

A lot of people, including myself, tried Atom out at the time.  If you read the reviews of that first release, the general consensus of the time was that it was a set of great ideas, but was held back by a small ecosystem and a potentially "too slow" implementation.  A year and a half later though, Atom has gone 1.0 and has had time to build up a community.  So I want to go in depth on where it stands today, and whether it makes sense for you to be using it.
